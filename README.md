GistVis is a proof-of-concept research prototype that aims to provide in-situ augmentation of data-rich documents. GistVis blends the power of Large Language Model (LLM) and Visualization Design Knowledge to automatically generate word-scale visualizations (WSV) within documents.

GistVis is also actively evolving as the technical toolchain evolves (prototype implementation in `releases/gistvis-prototype` branch). Building on the research prototype's modular design, our team's immediate next step is separating and improving the WSV module into a React component library to facilitate research and application with WSVs. We welcome constructive criticisms and contributions.

## Using GistVis

We are working on publisishing a website for our project. Stay tuned!
