    definition: `
      Comparisons is deﬁned on a 4-tuple (Xi, Dj, f , ∂ ).∀ xm, xn ∈ Xi, fD j(xm,xn) ≥ ∂ where f calculates the distance between xm and xn on Dj.
      Typically, comparisons involve two or more entities or values that exhibit significant differences. 
      Comparative relationships are often expressed in phrases containing multiple entities or values that highlight notable disparities.
      Generally, sentences containing multiple sets of data are more suitable for this type and focus on difference.`,
    examples: [
      `China on Wednesday posted a robust GDP growth of 5.2 percent for 2023, successfully beating the government's pre-set yearly target of around 5 percent.`,
      `There are more blocked beds in the Royal London Hospital compared with the UK average.`,
      `The average salary in tech companies is 30% higher than in traditional industries.`,
    ],
    negativeExamples: [
      `The little boy was careful enough to come first in the exam.`,
      `The temperature reached 30 degrees today.`,
      `Annual revenue grew by 12% last quarter.`

  // Trend presents a general tendency over a time segment.

  trend: {
    definition: `
      Trend is defined on a 6-tuple (Xi, Dj, T, t1, t2, R). R describes the movement feature of VDj(Xi) on T in the segment defined by t1 and t2. T is usually a temporal attribute.
      Temporal changes usually consist of an entity and a phrase with changing semantics such as:
       "increase", "rise", "grow" for positive trends
       "decrease", "fall", "decline" for negative trends
       For invariable trends: 
       Keywords like "unchanged", "stable", "remain constant", "virtually unchanged"
       Variation within ±10% of the average value
       No significant directional change indicated.`,
    examples: [
      `China's population decreased by 2.08 million people in 2023 to 1.40967 billion.`,
      `The budget for the Border Patrol Program has been rising from 1990 to 2013.`,
      `The unemployment rate has remained stable at around 5% throughout 2023.`,

  rank: {
    definition: `
      Rank is deﬁned on a 4-tuple (xm, Xi, dn, R). Ris the order of Vdn(xm) in sorted Vdn(Xi).
      Rank refers to sorting the data attributes based on their values and showing the position of selected data attributes. 
      Rank usually includes entities and their corresponding sorting, which can be numbers such as 1 and NO.2, as well as letters and words such as "great" and "A level".`,
    examples: [
      `The little boy was careful enough to come first in the exam.`,
      `The top reason for consumers to engage in showrooming is (the) price (is) better online.`,
      `Japan ranks third globally in GDP.`,

  proportion: {
    definition: `
    Proportion refers to measuring the proportion of selected data attribute(s) within a specified set. Proportions are usually a ratio or a fraction of one component compared to the whole, usually with phrases nearby that indicate proportion, such as "account for".
    If the decimals in the sentence point to the same whole, especially when the sum of these decimals is 1, it is more likely to belong to this type. Otherwise, it is more likely to belong to comparisons/ranks.`,
    examples: [
      `Traffic is one of the biggest sources of carbon pollution in the country and accounts for 28% of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.`,
      `Protein takes 66% of the diet on Sunday.`,
      `Renewable energy makes up 40% of total power generation.`,

    Extreme refers to the extreme data cases along with the data attributes or within a certain range, can only be maximum and minimum. Notice that anomalies are individual data points and do not include trends such as "increase".`,
    examples: [

  value: {
    definition: `
    Derived value is deﬁned on a 3-tuple (Xi, dn, R) where R is a derived value of Xi on dn. When Xi contains only 1 element, R is the value of the element on dn.
    Values are usually numerical valuesthat have a significant impact on entities.`,
