## Purpose of Each Folder

### 1. `demo/` Directory

This directory contains the code for the **demo page**, which showcases the basic functionality of the project and provides an interactive experience for users to generate visualizations.

- **`index.ts`**: The entry point for the demo page. This file is responsible for loading and rendering the demo page content.
- **`DemoComponent.tsx`**: The main component that handles the interactive features of the demo page. It allows users to generate and view different visualizations.

### 2. `User Study/` Directory

The **User Study** code is located here. It is designed for users to explore data, view articles, and interact with visualizations generated by the project.

- **`page1.ts`**: The entry file for the UserStudy page, where data is displayed, and users can engage with the generated content.
- **`page2.tsx`**: The component that handles rendering the articles and visualizations in the experiment page. It enables users to explore the generated visual content.

### 3. `modules/` Directory

The **core modules** of the project are housed here. These modules contain the logic for interacting with large models and generating visualizations.

#### - `discoverer/`, `annotator/`, `extractor/`

These folders contain code related to different large models used in the project. Each folder may contain:

- **`index.ts`**: The main entry file for each large model, responsible for loading, running computations, and outputting the results.

#### - `visualizer/`

This folder handles the **visualization logic** and contains reusable components for displaying the generated visualizations:

- **`index.ts`**: The entry file for the visualization module. It configures and loads the necessary components for rendering the visualizations.
- **`components/`**: A subfolder contain
